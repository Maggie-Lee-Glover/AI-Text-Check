# 🧠 AI Text Detector

This web app helps you **analyze written text for signs of AI generation**. It estimates the humanness of writing, highlights suspicious sentences, and even compares it against your own writing style.

Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), and a RoBERTa-based AI text classifier.
